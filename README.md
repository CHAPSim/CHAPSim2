# About CHAPSim 
A **CH**annel **A**nd **P**ipe flow **sim**ulation solver, *CHAPSim*, is described here. *CHAPSim* is an incompressible Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) code for flow and heat transfer with MPI parallelization. This repository contains the latest stable version. 

## Code Development History
The early version of CHAPSim was developed by Dr Mehdi Seddighi-Moornani in f77 platform for simulations of unsteady turbulent flows in a channel during his PhD study starting from 2007. The code has later been revamped by Dr Wei Wang for solving thermo-fluids problems in f90 platform in 2014/2015. All this early development work was carried out while Drs Seddighi-Moornani and Wang were working with Professor Shuisheng He at Universities of Aberdeen and Sheffield. In 2020, CHAPSim was selected by CCP.NTH to be developed as an open-source community code in partnership with STFC Daresbury Laboratory (Contact: Dr Wei Wang), Liverpool John Moores University (Contact: Dr Mehdi Seddighi) and University of Sheffield (Contact: Professor Shuisheng He) and released under the GNU General Public License, that is a free, copyleft license.

# Code Building
## Source Download and Compilation
Acquire the source code by cloning the git repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:CHAPSim/CHAPSim2.git
```
Compile the codes:
```
mkdir bin obj mod
make all
```
Run the code:
```
mpirun -n 4 ./bin/CHAPSim2
```
## Updating an existing source tree
If you have previously downloaded *CHAPSim* using git clone, you can update the existing source tree using git pull rather than starting a new:
```
cd CHAPSim
git pull && make
```
