==================
List of Parameters
==================
For a complete view about how the `.ini` files are handled, besides to the default value applied to each parameter 
when not defined by the user, take a look at `src/modules.f90`.

[decomposition]
---------------
* ``nxdomain``, integer, the number of subdomains in the `X` direction.::

  - If a turbulence generate is simulated simultaneously to feed turbulence information to the main flow, then ``nxdomain = 2``. A default value is ``nxdomain = 1``.

* ``p_row``, integer, for a default `x-pencil`, it refers to the number of subdomains in the `Y` direction.

* ``p_col``, integer, for a default `x-pencil`, it refers to the number of subdomains in the `Z` direction.
  
  - ``p_row`` & ``p_col`` define the domain decomposition for parallel computation. Notice that the product of both should be equal to the number of computational cores where `ChapSim2` will run, and ``p_row = p_col = 0`` executes the code in auto-tuning mode. More information can be found at `2DECOMP&FFT <http://www.2decomp.org>`_\ ).

[domain]
--------

* ``icase``, integer, case index. The options are:
    - 0 - ICASE_OTHERS, a box or a cylinder case with user defined boundary conditions, with a default Cartesian Coordinates;
    - 1 - ICASE_CHANNEL, a channel flow
    - 2 - ICASE_PIPE, a pipe flow, with a default Cylindrical coordinates
    - 3 - ICASE_ANNUAL, an annular flow, with a default Cylindrical coordinates
    - 4 - ICASE_TGV3D, a cube for Talyor Green Vortex, with a Cartesian coordinates
    - 5 - ICASE_TGV2D; a 2-D Talyor Green Vortex, with a Cartesian coordinates
    - 6 - ICASE_SINETEST; a 1-D sinusoidal test

* ``lxx_xdom``, real, the streamwise (`X` by default) length of the computational domain. How many values provided depending on ``nxdomain``.
* ``lyt``, real, the Coordinates of the top of the computational domain in the `Y` or radial `R` direction. 
* ``lyb``, real, the Coordinates of the bottom of the computational domain in the `Y` or radial `R` direction. 
* ``lzz``, real, the spanwise (`Z` by default) length of the computational domain. 
    - The solver is dimensionless. The length provide is scaled. For example, scaled by half channel height in a channel flow and the outer radius in a pipe flow.
    - For an example of a channel flow with a turbulence generate to provide turbulence information to the downstream. ``lxx_xdom = 4.0, 12.0, lyt = 1.0, lyb = -1.0, lzz = 4.0``
